## What's myconfig?

_[myconfig](https://www.myconfig.store) is a simple, fast, secure and highly available remote store for all your dynamic configs._

[myconfig](https://www.myconfig.store) is a secure database which lets you store simple key-value pair config variables in the cloud and securely access it with a REST API endpoint uniquely generated just for you.

## Why myconfig?

[myconfig](https://www.myconfig.store) can be helpful in a dozen use-cases, let us tell you a few of them...

### Versioning

Suppose you are showing a version tag in the header or footer of your static or any kind of website and you just deployed a new version of it but forgot to update the version. What are you gonna do now? Use myconfig.store and keep updating your version with just one click!

### Server Status

You are showing your users the running status of your server in your app. What when your server itself goes down... where will you pull the status info from now? Use myconfig.store and store the info away from your servers and keep updating it accordingly to help your users know what‚Äôs going on.

### Remote Config

You created a firebase project and you have to use the same config over multiple servers and app repos. Keep it at one place and use the same API endpoint to access it. Update it smoothly if you change the firebase project and skip your slow CI/CD & tests to deploy all your projects.

### Beta Features

You want to roll out a new app feature but don‚Äôt want to release it to all your users at the same time, rather make it available first to users at a certain location or age group, or whatever. Store your conditional configuration at myconfig.store and give your users a smooth feature update.
